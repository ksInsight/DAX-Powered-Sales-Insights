# DAX-Powered-Sales-Insights
The DAX Equation: Profit and Orders

This repository contains the Power BI files and related resources for a comprehensive analysis of SuperStore sales data, with a strong emphasis on leveraging DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to extract meaningful insights and drive data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview

This project delves into the intricacies of SuperStore sales data, aiming to demonstrate the power and versatility of DAX within the Power BI environment. By employing a wide range of DAX functions and techniques, we've developed an interactive dashboard that provides a holistic view of sales performance, identifies key trends, and facilitates strategic planning.

The primary objectives of this project were:

* **To showcase the effective use of DAX for complex calculations and data manipulation.**
* **To create a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard for sales performance monitoring.**
* **To extract actionable insights that can inform business strategies and improve sales outcomes.**

## Key Features

* **Extensive Use of DAX Measures:**
    * Implementation of a diverse set of DAX functions, including `COUNT`, `SUM`, date and time functions (`MONTH`, `YEAR`, `DAY`), logical functions (`IF`, `SWITCH`), and more.
    * Clear demonstration of the distinctions and applications of New Measures, Quick Measures, and New Columns.
    * Creation of custom measures for calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total profit, quick profit cost, and order counts.
* **In-Depth Sales Analysis:**
    * Identification of top-performing products and categories, with a focus on "Dhokla" as a significant profit driver.
    * Detailed analysis of sales trends over time, including monthly order counts and daily sales patterns.
    * Evaluation of order distribution and customer behavior.
* **Interactive Data Visualization:**
    * Development of an intuitive and visually appealing Power BI dashboard.
    * Use of various chart types (bar charts, tables, slicers) to represent data effectively.
    * Implementation of interactive elements to allow users to explore the data and drill down into specific details.
* **15 Day Sales Forecasting:**
    * Implementation of time intelligence functions to create a 15 day sales forecast.
    * Visual representation of the forecast to assist in future planning.

## Dashboard Highlights

* **Top Sellers Visualization:**
    * A table displaying the products with the highest total profit, enabling quick identification of key revenue generators.
* **Order Trends Analysis:**
    * Bar charts illustrating the count of orders by month, revealing seasonal patterns and fluctuations in demand.
    * Visualisation of the count of orders and sum of order day, to provide a deeper understanding of the order patterns.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    * Display of essential metrics such as total profit, quick profit cost, total orders, and unique order counts.
    * Use of DAX measures to dynamically calculate and present these KPIs.
* **Interactive Slicers and Filters:**
    * Implementation of slicers to allow users to filter data by product, date, and other relevant dimensions.
    * This allows for a granular level of data exploration.

## DAX Functions Utilized

* **Date and Time Functions:** `MONTH`, `YEAR`, `DAY`, `DATE`, `DATESBETWEEN`
* **Logical Functions:** `IF`, `SWITCH`, `AND`, `OR`
* **Time Intelligence Functions:** `DATEADD`, `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR`
* **Filter Functions:** `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, `ALL`
* **Information Functions:** `ISBLANK`
* **Other functions:** `DIVIDE`
